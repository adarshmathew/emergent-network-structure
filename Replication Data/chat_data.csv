"crazy yo",261,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"probably around 50 million",1065,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"oh wow more than I thought",765,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"Wow",905,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"50-90 would be a good guess",707,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"50 million",401,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"but why so much for a painting lmao",261,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"I'll go higher with my next guess",186,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"50 million",215,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"because it's probably priceless",1117,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"original",1117,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"80 is a good guess",707,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"I'm going to say 80 as well",1065,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"right? art is so subjective and seems made up how they assign value",1271,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"Df: is that a fact?",116,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"I will go to 10 I think",498,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"but seriously, judging from the art market and notable sales of late, definitely closer to 100",1271,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"the 100 mil as the highest he sold for?",116,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"than not",1271,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"80 sounds good to me",215,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"but its an ugly pic lol",261,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"or 115 I think",1271,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"115 is the highest one of his has sold for",1326,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"yeah, 100 mil for me",116,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"
"Picasso's go for anywhere from 20 to 150",707,"7wkkvgw5a42aHmDwa2"

"I said 2200, basically double",644,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"3489 here",767,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"I think Philly is less violent than Baltimore. I said about 900.",780,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"

"baltimore is a little more rough than philly, but not much",518,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"

"Baltimore is bad",220,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"

"I also thought it would be lower in Philadelphia",183,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"so what are we going with?",77,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"The median here seems to be around 1500",79,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"1500",69,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"Philly is no where near as dangerous as Baltimore",1072,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"1500 sounds good to me",1372,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"really?",77,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"i still say 900",518,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"900 is good, but idk",785,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"yeah, I say lower",77,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"It should be lower in Philadelphia, so I guess about 1000.",1044,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"i think 1000",220,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"but isn't philly bigger too?",767,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"I am in agreement with 900",1072,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"cr still  think about 938",203,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"definitely not more than baltimore",518,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"K 1200?",79,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"I truly do not believe it is more than Baltimore. I have lived in PHL and visited Bmore on multiple occations",57,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"it should be lower in philly ?",644,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"Philly is bigger",780,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"

"lol",785,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"
"yeah",77,"8Y83eoFuqiidSmTko1"

"why did so many of us think that?",1320,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I said 21,000",843,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Doesn't spotify have this functionality?",628,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Good",193,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I said 10,000",1003,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"i wasn't sure. i guessed 60000",846,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I just wrote 100,000, crowdfunding for things like this can go above their initial amount.",860,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"yea, it sounds a little iffy to me",112,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"at least on the first try because of the hype",843,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I went way higher",248,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I interpreted the question differently than a lot I said 100000",940,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"50,000",248,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I went lower",942,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Yea I guessed 60k",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I think people care about music but they were asking for a lot of money therefore did not reach the goal",534,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"This type of crowdfunding typically raises 2/3 of the amount so I said 20,000",169,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Agree",1003,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"i think its a lot less",789,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"i feel like most crowdsourcing campaigns don't get the full amount",1320,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I think the equity would be attractive to big investors",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"20000 is good",193,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"yea agreed on them asking too much",112,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I dont think they reached the goal",942,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"jojo what are you basing the 2/3 figure on? is that a fact you know?",1320,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I'm sticking with 20,000",169,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Yeah the equity is an important point",860,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I thought it was high too, but people will try something out so they may have gotten a surge",843,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I THINK PEOPLE CARE ABOUT MUSIC BUT THEY WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN GET OUT OF THEIR INVESTMENT",425,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I am sticking with 10,000",1003,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"i believe i over estimated",846,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"True",193,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Yes agentscarn - 2/3 is the average figure",169,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I AM STAYING AT 10000",425,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"It's kind of tough to say on this one",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"does anyone have stats?  figures on other attempts?",112,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"they would get equity in the company in exchange for the money",942,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"i will drop my guess to around 25000",846,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"but is it a good investment?",942,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I think 20000 as well",1388,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"thanks jojo, that's helpful",1320,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I think 25000 is a good guess",942,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"It really depends on what they offer and even then they strangest things manage to make a lot of money on crowdfunding",248,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"mmm I still think Gen Y and boomers believe in the music industry",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"If the target is young people I still say 21,000 total after its spread on facebook and what not",843,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I would think they would have raised a little more than half thats why I said 20k",534,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I think I hold off on investing my own money",112,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"although it hasn't been that profitable for years",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"I can see this going over",1355,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"maybe not",846,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"It's a unique idea and could go above the amount for sure",860,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"Boomer here, bands started off playing for free!",112,"CYcxx8EWgRDQDgYrr1"
"thoughts?",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I don't see how they would raise all their money",1176,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I'm thinking maybe 200,000?",377,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"it is only headphones",1176,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"How much are you thinking",971,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I said 200,000",886,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I meant to say 100000",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I said 300000",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"200k seems about right",991,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"yes 200000",1375,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"People love their music.",377,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I have no idea",344,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"

"I went with 250,000.",354,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"true",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I say about 200000",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I’d say 200,000",1173,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"this question is just for the 2nd round seeking 100k lb?",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Lets go 200000",971,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"With so many headphone options I don’t see how",21,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I put 200000",344,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"after rethinking it",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"i agree with 200000",532,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"okay",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I went with 125k since they had already done a previous one maybe they didn't raise much more than the goal.",606,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"i said 130",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"how about 150000?",761,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"The most crownfunded funds were like millions and they were pppular things like the Criticl role series",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"165000",99,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I say go with 200000",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"And this is just headphones",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Yeah I think 200k is reasonable. Often when companies exceed goal they exceed by a lot:",354,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Ok 200000",344,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I think 200000 is optimistic, but okay.",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"200k lets all do it",971,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Think of beats headphones too",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I could see it becoming a trending thing if more and more people started donating thats why I'm thinking 200,000.",377,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"High end",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"i guess campaigns either don't hit/barely hit goals, or they way over-raise",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"yeah what james said",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"ok, 200k. Don't underestimate audiophiles and their gadgets.",606,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"200k sounds good to me",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"if they needed to raise a second round, doesnt that mean that the company has not been as successful",1176,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"why not 300???",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"where does it say high end?",761,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Like Beats!",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"That's what I was thinking",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"It doesn't say high end",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"why have to fund raise again",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Just says club and dance music",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"the description implies they are high end",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"I was saying beats are high end and look how much they are",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"it replicates the sound of being in a club",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"who even does that anymore",1176,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"(which ive been to, the sound is too loud to sound good anyuway)",1008,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"just means bass heavy",761,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"the sound and style like being in a club screams high end to me",539,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"youth will lov",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"Probably they wanted to get more funding to push more units and rsther than use their own money , looked to crowds",1199,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"It says first round was successful, and company has made thousands of sales, I think people would be eager to get equity in the company.",354,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"
"love",1031,"dncWdA8zokdaNNftM1"

"i doubt it was a successful campaign",623,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i think so",1114,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Hey, I went higher.",1147,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I don't think it will reach its goal",371,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I think they raised the full 10500 pounds (35%)",152,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i'm guessing they only raised about half",1340,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I think they raised the 15,000",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I don't think it met it's 30k goal because it would require people to go to physycal locations to listen to music they might not even like",188,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"The physical loactions thing sounds like a dealbreaker",688,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I am not sure it is a great idea",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"i said 15k also",188,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"true",1212,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I didn't think it was successful either. I said 19,000",82,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I think 10000",1131,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I'm not sure that it was successful.  I'm trying to think if I would actually use the service.",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I didn't get the chance to write in my prediction as the screen changed!",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"i think 12000",1114,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I am sticking with 15,000",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I wouldn't use it, so...",688,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I meant 1000",1131,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Mine said 30k was sought...i see other numbers",579,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I wouldn't buy it",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I said 6000",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Probably less than what they wanted",768,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"so maybe less than 15k",1340,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"There's so many streaming sites it's hard to compete",1212,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"What is the twist?",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i said 20k",1114,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"the idea of the app is good but i'm not sure how much they actually raised",305,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"you have to go find the songs. Kind of like a scavenger party.",579,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i said 30,000 but that's cuz i read the question wrong haha",305,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"What is the twist? The dropping at the physical location?",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"If your streaming services offer more than those out their you can make it",701,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"that's takes a lot of effort",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I like convenience",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Yes",1212,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"So it's Pokemon GO for music?",688,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"it would be fun for teenagers, which is probably the target audience.",579,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I'm going to stay at 15k",188,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"yeah",82,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Haha Pokemon GO for music",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i'm going with 9k, as my final answer",1340,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"yes, Pokemon Go for music",579,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I'm staying with 6000",88,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"I doubt I'd walk somewhere to hear music when its all on youtube",649,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"20000 for me",371,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"i stay at 20000",1114,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"I like being a le to listen any place without internet so down load is a must",701,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"go for it",40,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"I may drop my prediction to 10,000",691,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"19000",82,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"
"Yea people want to listen from their home",768,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb1"

"hey",570,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Hello",740,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Sounds like a great app. I'm sure it would be overfunded",521,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"hello",1207,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"No way they raised their goal",570,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Hi",439,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"10000",1232,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"

"It seems weird to me. I don't know why I'd want to drive somewhere to l isten to something.",229,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I doubt they raised a lot",431,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Maybe",1232,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I say 9000 being generous",570,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I said 19k, but I have no idea. My big concern is how investors would get their money back",43,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I said 8,000",431,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I think doubled",1085,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"

"I agree , I think maybe they raised half but not the full amount?",1207,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"yeah i said 20k but that was way generous",790,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"why would I go around and try to pick up songs by artists I don't know?",431,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Why would people want to go to a physical location to listen to music?",570,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"Geocacheing and Pokemon GO were huge",521,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I thought they would exceed their goal",927,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"yeah 20k is prob way too generous.",229,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"This is those for music.",521,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I guessed it shot over the amount they were asking for",740,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I guessed 30,000 because of Pokemon people",416,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"40,000",439,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I guess you are right about pokemon go type of setting but this requires people to basically give a ton of money upfront to even get it off the ground too",229,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I appreciate them trying to get people to walk more, but I don't think this is the way to do it",431,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"

"Music is different from a ""collect them all"" game",1293,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"decent amount of equity",1085,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I guessed 15000",1207,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I bet its either REALLY successful or flopped REALLY hard",43,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"People seem to love scavenger hunts",740,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"jd I agree with you",740,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"40,000 to 45,000",439,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"probably depends on where it is",441,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"I think if it was launched some pokemon go type of people would use it but I don't know if they'd actually fund it.",229,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"

"true it depends on their talent level too",229,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"
"They're saying pounds. People walk more there anyway.",521,"EWYCXxpH7totWFikb2"

"I said 2.0 million, but just guessing.",167,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I would go with 4 or less",28,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"I said 8 but have no idea",1196,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"I think the size of it may have made it more expensive",1087,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"7",1067,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"cause he's famous but it is not a very intricate painting",1143,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"somewhat of a sketch",1143,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"Its a drawing though. Not a painting could make it less",928,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"yeah size is a factor as well as who he is",1245,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"It's nice. I'd hang it in my home.",1087,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"It is not a very well known image and I think his paintings are more valuable than a charcoal",1015,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"The age of the painting and the fact that he is an historical figure makes me think at least 20 million",887,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"same here",94,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"i think because this isn't a more famous one it is worth less than a million",713,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I think I might stay at $4 million, but I still have no idea",3,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"Now Im thinking 250,000",928,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"total guess",94,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I think the fact that it is less famous than others makes it even more important...maybe an earlier work?",887,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"it is crazy. I'm no artist, but i know a lot goes into it",1245,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I will still say over 2",28,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I'm interested to find out what the price was",1087,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"less famous works means leass demand",713,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"No on over 10 mil?",654,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"5m seems good?",94,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"5 i think too",1245,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"no way it was over 10 or 5",713,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"7",1067,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"Not necessarily, less famous means hidden treasure!!",887,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"Well I want to know now",928,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"
"I'm gonna stick with a low ball number. Maybe 2 mil.",995,"Wwpnhp6e4i7LeDamm1"

"Hi,so what do you all think?",591,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I said 10,000",461,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I said 40000 I think they exceeded their goal but not certain by how much",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I said 5000",712,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Hi all! I thought it raised 38,000. It's a creative idea and I haven't heard of anything similar",778,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It's a fairly unique idea",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"i said 12000....didn't sound like a big money maker to me",1306,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I thught it was a good idea and said 70000",273,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Yes higher but for sure they met the goal",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Tough to estimate. Does this app sound useful? I said 7000",558,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I said 15,000. But im a pessimist  :)",880,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It sounds like a lot of hassle to me",461,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"5000",816,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I said 20,000. thought it'd be close but not quite",672,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I say 30,000  sounds like a great idea",812,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"People don’t like to pay for music, in general.",712,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"now I'm confused",445,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"A unique idea doesnt mean itll generate the full crowdfunding amount",1374,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I think they will far exceed their goal",273,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It is actually pretty cool and would get a lot of support from venues as well",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I thought so too",445,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Interesting idea, but musicians are usually broke (I'm one).",912,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"And you have to go to a specific location to listen to it on an app?!",461,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I know many unique crowdfunding ideas that far surpassed what they asked for and they were concepts people might not find useful",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"its like pokemon go without the pokemon",1374,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"The concept is good and it would encourage and promote a lot of side things",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"will musicians travel to certain spots just to listen to a new song?",1306,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"What's its advantage?",558,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It's unlikely that the app raised exactly 30000.  It probably fell shorted or surpassed its goal by a lot - typical of crowdsourcing.",451,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I don't see how it could take so much money for this app to be made",816,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It gets people out of the house and doing things which seems fun",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Lazy and cheap people. Not sure if it would be a big money maker.",712,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I think it made it's goal",445,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"agreed. would be good for runners and walkers",1374,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"but not much else",1374,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Its definitely unique, like the idea of it being pokemon go with music",812,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I say 35000, how about if Mick Jagger dropped at a location",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"and people visiting different cities to check out local music from that area",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I say 17000",591,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Why would people do this when they can just download new music onto their phone or iPod?",461,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I'm going to say that it failed - reached only 10000.",451,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"That's a great idea though  reminds me a Pokemon go in a way",816,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I agree it is unique. Just not sure it has the market,.",712,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I'm sticking with 35000",445,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"It would catch on and some big peeps would drop at locations",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"if is the functioning word there",1374,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"because downloading new music to your iPod isn't really a whole experience",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"it'll probably hit the goal....musicians are interesting sorts",1306,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"people like to take part in things",983,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"Most of us go to locations to hear music anyway, why would this be differnt.",273,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"
"I say 35k at least",878,"XRkw2v5KAM2aHdQic1"

"I figured more than Baltimore, but I didn't know how much more.",1104,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"2500 here",1059,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"it's over 1200 shot in 2019 so far",569,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"The average homocide rate in Chicago is lower than Memphis, TN.",507,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"Chicago is much bigger than Baltimore",345,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"so for 2018, going by that trending, maybe close to 2500 or higher",569,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"true",1275,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"I am going to go with less than a 1,000",946,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"keep in mind this is about shootings, not just homicides",569,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"definitely over 1000",254,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"Less than 1000?!",1059,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"5000?",1275,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"like if a person sees a gun, an event is logged",72,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"I am thinking an event is gun deaths",946,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"I guessed 35",973,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"Yeah, 1 person shooting 10 people is considered ""an event""",507,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"It's not homicide rate though, it's gun violence acts",1104,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"it just says gun violence, not homicides",569,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"Sooo zero??",1275,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"Yes it could mean a number of gun incidents.",62,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"Then I am going to say around 2,000",946,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"You'd have to consider the crime rate and accidents also, since they log all gun violence",345,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"No, not zero",1104,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"
"5000?",37,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa2"

"hey",1089,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"i said 1300 because chicago is a bigger city",49,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"yes it is",417,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Chicago has the highest rate of gun violence in the US.",987,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I guess so",1177,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Yea",1177,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Chicago obviously should be a higher number.",1222,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"but baltimore is pretty violent?",49,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Anyone have a good guess? I know it's higher",1169,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"chicago gun rate is actually less",1089,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I remember hearing this in the news",987,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"

"I was thinking the same thing",1369,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Its Chicago so its high",489,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"so...i thought this would be computation....but i also guessed chicago beats out baltimore",1263,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"i said only 500",700,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"i wouldn't be surprised if chicagos is double that of baltimore",417,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"

"I said like 1984",987,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Agreed",1415,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"

"I said 1200",1006,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I tossed out 2500",692,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I say at least 2000",489,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"It has to be around 1500 if not some more",1369,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I thought more like 2000",168,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"3000 is too much",49,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"I thought it was closer to 3000 too",1169,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"Thinking Chicago is higher",1415,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"

"2000 reasonable",313,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
"baltimore isnt a good place for crime but not as bad as chicago",417,"Z37S3mAMREXsiGzxa3"
